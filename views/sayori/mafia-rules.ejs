        <p class="lead">Rules? Why not?</p>
    </header>

    <div class="container mt-4">
        Mafia is a logic-based game. <br> Repeated personal targetting, metagaming, or illogical spam accusations ruin the fun for everyone.
    </div>

    <div class="container mt-4">

        <h2>1. No personal targetting</h2>
        <p>Players cannot repeatedly vote or accuse the same person without in-game reasoning.</p>
        <h3>Examples of wrong conducts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let's all vote Satviky because I hate her.</li>
            <li>Let's all vote Satviky cuz the other person remaining is my friend.</li>
            <li>Let's all vote Endeavor cuz whenever he plays he is the mafia.</li>
            <li>Let's all vote Jessy otherwise she will catch me.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If someone repeats this illogical behaviour, they will start to recieve warnings and on repeated infractions mafia blacklist.</p>

        <h2>2. All accusations must have Game-Based logic</h2>
        <p>If you are planning to target someone then at least give ONE in-game reason:
        <p>
            <h3>Acceptable Reasons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suspicious Message.</li>
            <li>Night Action Misalignment.</li>
            <li>Vote Pattern.</li>
            <li>Weird Defence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a player cannot provide <strong>any</strong> reason -> acusation is <strong>Invalid</strong></p>

        <h2>3. No out of Game knowing</h2>
        <h3>Player cannot use:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Past games</li>
            <li>Friendship</li>
            <li>Behaviour outside games</li>
            <li>VC talks</li>
            <li>Private chats</li>
            <li>Teaming up with actual mafia to ruin the experience of others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. No Fake Info Flooding</h2>
        <p>Players cannot spam false accusations repeatedly to manupulate others.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's Kaddu. <strong>TRUST ME BRO</strong></li>
            <li>It's definitely Endeavor and Satviky [There is only 1 Mafia]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This reduces fun and confuses new players.</p>

        <h2>5. Mafia players cannot Hard-Accuse Randomly</h2>
        <p>If you are Mafia, you are allowed to lie...</p>
        <p>... but <strong>you can't break rule #1 by personally targetting the same person with no in-game logic.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mafia saying <strong>'IT'S SATVIKY'</strong> every message</li>
            <li>Forcing others to dogpile</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is <strong>not bluffing,</strong> it's <strong>rule-breaking</strong></p>
        <h2>6. No asking others to vote xyz without explaination</h2>
        <p>If you are asking everyone to agree to vote xyz, then give good reason to <strong>Why</strong> everyone should vote XYZ.</p>
        <h2>7. No revealing of roles</h2>
        <p>You can't send screenshot of DM sent by Sayori to prove that you are not Mafia.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can keep saying I am detective, I am doctor but you are not allowed to share DM screenshots as proof.</li>
            <li>In case of singe mafia, If in the end of night Sayori sends a message saying "Mafia tried to kill `xyz` but doctor saved them", then this message can be used by xyz as proof of them not being mafia, and this is considered a fair use.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="container mt-4">
        <p>Lastly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Play respectfully</li>
            <li>Don't think that you know the game better than the developers.</li>
            <li>No bullying in name of game</li>
        </ul>
       </div>

       <div class="container mt-4" id="devrules">
        <h2>Bonus for bot's devs:</h2>
        <p>Four pillars of Mafia [Satviky, Kaddu, Jessy, Shadowveil_Studioz] are not allowed to play together except for testing rounds.</p>
        <p>In case they are playing together, it's against the rules for any of them to kill each other.</p>
        <p>It may look weird to set up the rules for devs, but this is really important to maintain the credibility of developers and ensure the healthy team building.</p>
